# SINGA-DeepLearning
In `examples/cifar10/`, only two files have been modified.

1. `myoptimizer.py` was a new file, created from original `optimizer.py`.
    In it, class like `SGD` etc. has been replaced by five new classes, each corresponds to one of our five experiments settings.

2. `train.py` has been modified. Right now, `opt` will be created following    different settings.

All modified parts in above files are highlighted by using notification like following:
